Importent points to remember in C++:
## 1. Complier Errors
All the programming languages have rules. And, Compiler Error occurs when the compiler is unable to convert the code into executable program.
There are two types of Compiler Error:
a. Syntax Error 
This error indicates that there is something wrong in the structure of the code.

b. Semantic Error
This error indicates that there is issue in the meaning of the program which compiler is unable to convert. This indicates that Code is not logically correct.


## 2. Compiler Warnings
These are the message thrown by the Compiler indicating that potential problems in the Code. These warnings dont prevent your code from compiling, these often leads to bugs or unexpected behaviours during execution.

## 3. Linker Errors
## 4. Runtime Errors
## 5. Logic  Errors
