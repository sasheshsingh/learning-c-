# Stack vs Heap Memory


### Stack
The allocation happens on contiguous blocks of memory. We call it a stack memory allocation because the allocation happens in the function call stack.


### Heap

The memory is allocated during execution of the program.
Heap Memory should be explicitly allocated and release when not required.
